# Coding Test of Meisterwerk

This is a sample repository containing the coding test code for Meisterwerk. It demonstrates the implementation of the assigned task and provides instructions to set up and run the project.

## Tech Stack

| Technology       | Version |
|-------------------|---------|
| Expo             | 52      |
| React Native     | 0.76    |

## Setup Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:preetvadaliya/mw-rn-case.git
   ```

2. Note: There is no environment setup required. Server URLs are hardcoded to reduce the setup time. In the future, these could be configured using `expo-constants` or `dotenv` for different environments such as local and production.

3. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd mw-rn-case
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

That's it! The app should now be running.
