# Coding Test of Meisterwerk

This is a sample repository containing the coding test code for Meisterwerk. It demonstrates the implementation of the assigned task and provides instructions to set up and run the project.

## Tech Stack

| Technology       | Version |
|-------------------|---------|
| Expo             | 52      |
| React Native     | 0.76    |

## Setup Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:preetvadaliya/mw-rn-case.git
   ```

2. Note: There is no environment setup required. Server URLs are hardcoded to reduce the setup time. In the future, these could be configured using `expo-constants` or `dotenv` for different environments such as local and production.

3. Users are explicitly reminded to start the dummy server before running the app.

4. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd mw-rn-case
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

That's it! The app should now be running. I have tested the application thoroughly on the iOS simulator, as I currently do not have access to an Android system. I hope the application performs as expected on Android devices as well.
